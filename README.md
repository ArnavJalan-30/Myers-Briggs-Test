# Myers-Briggs-Test
 repo containing project files files for my Database Management course where we have created a Myers Briggs Personality Test which indicates the 4 personality types a user has based on their responses to a few a questions. It is implemented in MySql and the backend/frontend is executed in python. 

Refer to the report for indepth analysis of the code and to see a working demo

Learning Outcomes-
- Since I am not very proficient in Front end development the UI is poor and something that could be worked on.
- The MySql Tables could have been more optimized using Procedures and Triggers but our main logic lies in the python script.
